This is where you propose ideas. We discuss them in the comment section below. After adequate discussion, we finalize the concept. No actual programming, just pseudo code. No actual art, just sketches and mockups.

Go into as much detail as possible, and/or ask as many questions as possible to encourage discussion in the comment section below.
